# PyCaret Machine Learning API Example
This repository demonstrates the use of PyCaret to build, train, and deploy machine learning models as APIs. PyCaret is an open-source, low-code machine learning library that simplifies building and deploying machine learning models.

# Features
Train machine learning models using PyCaret's classification module.

Deploy models as APIs using FastAPI.

Generate predictions from the deployed API.

Requirements

# Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher

PyCaret

Install the required libraries:

pip install pycaret

pip install fastapi

pip install pycaret[mlops]

# Usage

**Train a Classification Model on the Diabetes Dataset**

This example demonstrates training an XGBoost classifier on the diabetes dataset.

**Train and Deploy Logistic Regression Model as an API**

This example demonstrates training a logistic regression model on the Juice dataset and deploying it as an API.

**Train and Deploy a Model with a Flask Application**

This example demonstrates training a logistic regression model on the Juice dataset and deploying it as a Flask application.

# Files

**lr_api.py:** FastAPI script generated by create_api for serving the logistic regression model.

**app.py:** Flask application script generated by create_app for serving the logistic regression model.

# Running the API

- After running the create_api or create_app command, execute the generated script.

- The API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
